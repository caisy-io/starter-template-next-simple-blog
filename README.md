# Simple blog starter template with Next.js and caisy

## ðŸ“£ Important Notice: ~~Page Router~~ -> App Router

**This repository** is now utilizing the new Next.js **App Router**, which will become the default standard going forward.
Should you be interested in a version that uses the legacy AppRouter, you can find it at the following repository: [starter-template-next-simple-blog-pagerouter](https://github.com/caisy-io/starter-template-next-simple-blog-pagerouter).
Please note that it is compatible with this repository, and you can follow along the onboarding process just the same.

# App Router

- ### The `app` Router

The App Router is a new paradigm for building applications using React's latest features.

In version 13, Next.js introduced a new App Router built on [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components), which supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.

The App Router works in a new directory named `app`. The `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the `pages` directory for previous behavior. If your application uses the `pages` directory, please also see the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) documentation.

- ### Component Hierarchy

The React components defined in special files of a route segment are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

- `layout.js`

- `template.js`

- `error.js` (React error boundary)

- `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)

- `not-found.js` (React error boundary)

- `page.js` or nested layout.js

In a nested route, the components of a segment will be nested inside the components of its parent segment.
